This is a tool to convert animated GIFs to spritemaps (a bitmap listing each frame). 

The resulting Spritemap can be wither in .png format or in DirectDraw Surface (.dds) format.

To use the tool, add one or more animated gifs and click go. The resulting bitmap/dds is saved to the Windows temporary directory and displayed.
